Assignment 4

To test performance I have implemented the Levenshtein distance and matrix
multiplication. They both use only objects and primitives that are specific to
the foundation framework eg. NSInteger, NSArray and so on.

The Levenhstein is implemented using the dynamic programming technique, by using
a memo.
