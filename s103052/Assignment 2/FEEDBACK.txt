addChild Method:

You don't check if "self" is single. And you don't set "self's" spouse to be the other parent of the child.

can_marry Method:

To check if Aperson is contained in the children array I'm using the containsObject method, I don't know if it is more effective or not.

marryNoble Method:

To make the method more readable I would have made at least one helper method that would distribute the noble persons assets.


There is not really anything to review on the second part of the assignment.
