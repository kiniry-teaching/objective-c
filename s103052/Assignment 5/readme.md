Assignment 5
============

The purpose with Assignment 5 is to design and implement an already know API from java to Objective-C. 
I have choosen to implement the java.util.Random from JRE System Library (JavaSE-1.7). 
Not all methods are implemented in the classes. These methods will just send out a NSLog message saying "unimplmented" and make a 'false' assertion.
