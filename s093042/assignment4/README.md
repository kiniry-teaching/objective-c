## Assigment 4

The results from instruments are a little of in the time profiler, because the profiling allocations, injects method calls inside the code, making them falsely timere, but can still identify the places in the code, where the control is the most of the time.
But since testing to find complexities will require the actual times, the projects also include the possiblity to set an increasing number of iterations or elements, and print out the computation times in ms.
