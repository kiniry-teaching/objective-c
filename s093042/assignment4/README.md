## Assigment 4

The results from instruments are a little of in the time profiler, because the profiling allocations, injects method calls inside the code, making them falsely timere, but can still identify the places in the code, where the control is the most of the time.
But since testing to find complexities will require the actual times, the projects also include the possiblity to set an increasing number of iterations or elements, and print out the computation times in ms.

As it can be seen the complexity of all operations tested, they are linear to the times they are run. Foundation framework, it is also seen that getting an object in various sizes of a dictionary either mutable or not, id no dependent on the number of elements in the dictionary.

The complexities on Matrix multiplication is powered. and the complexity of finding the levenshtein distance is exponential. This is really not interesting in context of objective-C, but as it is seen in the instruments data, the allocations made are â€¦.
