Peer-review on Assignment 2 - Part 1
====================================
### To Jesper Baltzersen (s100182) from Carsten Nilsson (s093751)

* Wouldn't it be possible to set the gender in the initialization method? Instead of doing it afterwards.
* The divorce method could split their assets (minor detail)
* The `addChild` method uses a switch with the gender typedef enum -- I actually didn't know this worked, so very nice to know!

### Overall assessment
I think you solution is well written and I don't see any concrete issues.
