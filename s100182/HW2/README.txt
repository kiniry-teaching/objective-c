I didn't really get to this part. 
There are a few comments in the code.

The only things from part 2 i have looked at are protocols and blocks.

I managed to implement protocols using the delegation pattern in the files with the lottery prefix. 

The only other thing i looked at was blocks. One worked early but then I tried putting 3 blocks in a dictionary and from there nothing ever got back to normal:-(

As far as comparing Java and Objective-c goes i don't have much. 
I guess protocols and interfaces are more or less the same but we haven't covered interfaces yet (I'm on 1. semester) so I'm not completely sure.
From what I understand block will come to Java as anonymous functions in Java 8 but since I didn't really get them working I don't have much to say about it.
