* GNUstep setup
System > Core > Devel (IN THAT PARTICULAR ORDER!) from http://www.gnustep.org/experience/Windows.html
To build without makefile, something like: gcc -o hello main.m -L /c/GNUstep/GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries -I /c/GNUstep/GNUstep/System/Library/Headers/ -lobjc -lgnustep-base -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString

* gcc docs
** Overall options
-L/-I for libs/headers. VERY useful with GNUstep
-o executable name

** objc(++) options
-lobjc to use objc
-fconstant-string-class=class-name
Used this to force NSConstantString as opposed to NXConstantString

Of interest
-Wundeclared-selector
-

** optimizations
-O<n> = n _mostly_ just switches other opt flags
-Os = space over speed
-O1 = some optimizations
-O2 = heavy optimizations
-O3 = very heavy optimizations
-O0 = default, fast, good for debugging

mostly like clang

** FSF docs in generel
texinfo, one source to all outputs
Emacs has awesome support for this (its docs are texinfo)!
see textest.info
