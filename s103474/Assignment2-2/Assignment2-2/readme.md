# Read-me for assignment 2, part 2

I tried to cover as many of the 29 points as I had time for. I have a hunch regarding most of them, but I didn't have time to research and write a complete answer for all points.

All of the things I want to say concerning each point is written in the code comments for each, listed one by one in the main.m file. All code is laid out in this file, but uses code from the two utility classes, “Tim” and “Tom”.
