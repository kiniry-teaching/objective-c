/***** Peer Review performed by: Christian Poulsen, S103052 *****/

Part 1:
+ Overall it seems like a good implementation. It's a simple and readable code, that actually doesn't need comments to understand.

- The test of your classes in the main could have been a little bit more readable and structured in my opinion.


Part 2:
- Not many of the reflection questions are answered and no classes for experiments are implemented, so I don't have much to review in the second part.
