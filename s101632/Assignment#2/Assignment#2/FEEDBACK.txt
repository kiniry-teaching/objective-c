There is no README file so i haven't got much to go on besides code. Also there are very few comments in the code.

Citizen.m:
- Implementations are very similar. Jacob has chosen to separate impediments to marriage and the actual marry method. I have them in the same method. 
I think separating the two is the right design choice. Impediment could be thought of as a query and marry is a command, thus breaking the "command query separation principle" by putting both in the same method.
Also Joe's solution has an invariant which is kind of the same thing. 

Jacob's solution does not have a divorce method.
I have chosen to auto set gender of a childs parents and added a description method for easier debugging with NSLog. None of those functions are necessary.      

NoblePerson.m:
- These are almost identical

FunWithBlocks.m:
- The first test under blocks in main.h looks right to me. I don't know how to import the files to Xcode (and don't have to time to figure it out) and therefore I can't see if it's working. 
I don't know about the last part. 

I guess it's all working, but there are very few comments and I don't know objective-c well enough to know if it works.

FunWithProtocols:
- Implementations are somewhat similar. We both use the delegate pattern for testing protocols. 

FunWithNil:
- Good little experiment for showing difference between Java and Objective-c in this field. I don't have anything to compare this to.
