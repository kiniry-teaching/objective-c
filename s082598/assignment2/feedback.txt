Assignment 2 feedback for s082598

- From Xcode 4.4 and on you don't need to synthezise your properties. The will automatically be initalized.

- I think that the Apple way is to use only istance variables (_property) in the inilialize methods and self.property everywhere else.

- You declare both children and spouse both as public and private properties?

Other than that everything looks fine!
